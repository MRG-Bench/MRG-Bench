It uses the `parse_stat_result` function to retrieve the file's metadata using the `stat_result` object. Finally, it returns a `FileInfo` object containing the file's information.\n\nThe `FileInfo` object is a dictionary containing the file's path, size, creation date, modification date, and access date.

It uses the `stat` function to retrieve the file's metadata and returns a `stat_result` object containing the metadata.\n\nThe `stat_result` object is a dictionary containing the file's metadata, including its size, creation date, modification date, and access date. The `size` and creation date, modification date, and access date are obtained from the `st_size`, `st_ctime`, `st_mtime`, and `st_atime` attributes, respectively.\n\nThe `PathType` and `stat_result` are type hints indicating the expected type of the `path` argument and the return type, respectively. These type hints are used by the IDE to provide type checking and code completion.\n\nPlease note that the `FileInfo` and `stat_result` objects are not necessarily standard Python objects, but they are likely to be defined in the `litestar` package as part of the `file_system.py` module.", "```\nasync def parse_stat_result(path: PathType, result: stat_result) -> FileInfo:\n    file_info = {\n        \"path\": path,\n        \"size\": result.st_size,\n        \"mtime\": result.st_mtime,\n        \"atime\": result.st_atime,\n        \"ctime\": result.st_ctime,\n        \"type\": result.st_mode,\n        \"uid\": result.st_uid,\n        \"gid\": result.st_gid,\n        \"permissions\": result.st_mode,\n    }\n    return file_info\n```\nThis code defines a function called `parse_stat_result` that takes two arguments: `path`, which is a file path, and `result`, which is an object of type `stat_result`. The function returns a dictionary of file information.\n\nThe function first creates an empty dictionary called `file_info`. It then adds several elements to the dictionary based on the fields of the `stat_result` object:\n\n* `path`: The given file path.\n* `size`: The size of the file in bytes.\n* `mtime`: The time the file was last modified.\n* `atime`: The time the file was last accessed.\n* `ctime`: The time the file was last changed (i.e., created or last modified).\n* `type`: The type of the file, which is a Unix file mode.\n* `uid`: The user ID of the file owner.\n* `gid`: The group ID of the file owner.\n* `permissions`: The permissions of the file, which is a Unix file mode.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `file_info` dictionary."]}, "litestar-litestar/typing.py-has_inner_subclass_of": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: litestar/typing.py\n function: \n```\ndef is_subclass_of(self, cl: type[Any] | tuple[type[Any], ...]) -> bool:\n```\n# Function Signature: def has_inner_subclass_of(self, cl: type[Any] | tuple[type[Any], ...]) -> bool:\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Whether any generic args are a subclass of the given type.\n\n        Args:\n            cl: The type to check, or tuple of types.

The `generate_content` method is expected to return a mapping of media types to examples, where each example is represented as a `Mapping[str, Any]` object.\n\nThe `create_additional_responses` method is a generator function, which means it can be used to iterate over the additional responses without having to create the entire list in memory.

If the `description` attribute is missing, it raises a `ValueError` with an informative message.\n\nPlease note that the code snippet is not a complete working example, and it requires the `litestar` package to be installed and imported.

The function uses a comprehension to create the string by iterating over the items in the dictionary and calling the `write()` method of the type object to get its string representation. The comprehension creates a list of strings in the format \"key: type\", where \"type\" is the string representation of the type object. The list is then joined with commas to create the final string.", "```\ndef write(self) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Write a typescript interface object, without a name.\n\n    Example:\n        {\n            key: string;\n            optional?: number;\n        }\n\n    Returns:\n        A typescript string\n    \"\"\"\n    result = \"\"\n    # Write the opening brace\n    result += \"{\"\n\n    # Write the properties\n    for property in self.properties:\n        result += property.write()\n        result += \";\"\n\n    # Write the closing brace\n    result += \"}\"\n\n    return result\n```\nPlease note that this is just one possible implementation of the `write` method for the `TypescriptInterface` class, and there may be other ways to implement it depending on your specific requirements and constraints.\n\nAlso, please note that the `write` method is a member function of the `TypescriptInterface` class, so it is called on an instance of the class, not on the class itself.\n\nFor example, if you have an instance of the class `TypescriptInterface` called `interface`, you would call the `write` method like this:\n```\ninterface.write()\n```\nThis would return a string representation of the typescript interface object, without a name.\n\nYou can also use the `add_property` method to add properties to the interface object before calling the `write` method. For example:\n```\ninterface.add_property(\"key\", \"string\")\ninterface.add_property(\"optional\", \"number\", True)\n```\nThis would add two properties to the interface object, with the names \"key\" and \"optional\", and the types \"string\" and \"number\" respectively. The `optional` property is marked as optional by passing `True` as the third argument to the `add_property` method.\n\nI hope this helps!

It creates a string representation of a typescript interface object without a name, which is returned at the end of the method. The method iterates over the keys in the interface, checks the value for each key, and adds it to the interface string accordingly.\n\nPlease note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to handle more complex cases, such as nested interfaces, enums, and other data types. Additionally, you would need to add error handling and validation to ensure that the generated code is correct and compiles without errors."]}, "litestar-litestar/testing/helpers.py-create_test_client": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: litestar/utils/predicates.py\n function: \n```\ndef is_class_and_subclass(annotation: Any, type_or_type_tuple: type[T] | tuple[type[T], ...]) -> TypeGuard[type[T]]:\n```\n# Function Signature: def create_test_client(\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Create a Litestar app instance and initializes it.\n\n    :class:`TestClient <litestar.testing.TestClient>` with it.\n\n    Notes:\n        - This function should be called as a context manager to ensure async startup and shutdown are\n            handled correctly.\n\n    Examples:\n        .. code-block:: python\n\n            from litestar import get\n            from litestar.testing import create_test_client\n\n\n            @get(\"/some-path\")\n            def my_handler() -> dict[str, str]:\n                return {\"hello\": \"world\"}\n\n\n            def test_my_handler() -> None:\n                with create_test_client(my_handler) as client:\n                    response = client.get(\"/some-path\")\n                    assert response.json() == {\"hello\": \"world\"}\n\n    Args:\n        route_handlers: A single handler or a sequence of route handlers, which can include instances of\n            :class:`Router <litestar.router.Router>`, subclasses of :class:`Controller <.controller.Controller>` or\n            any function decorated by the route handler decorators.\n        backend: The async backend to use, options are \"asyncio\" or \"trio\".\n        backend_options: ``anyio`` options.\n        base_url: URL scheme and domain for test request paths, e.g. ``http://testserver``.\n        raise_server_exceptions: Flag for underlying the test client to raise server exceptions instead of wrapping them\n            in an HTTP response.\n        root_path: Path prefix for requests.\n        session_config: Configuration for Session Middleware class to create raw session cookies for request to the\n            route handlers.\n        after_exception: A sequence of :class:`exception hook handlers <.types.AfterExceptionHookHandler>`.

The decorator takes in a function as an argument and wraps it with a warning message that is generated based on the parameters passed to the `deprecated` function. The decorated function is then returned.\n\nThe `deprecated` function takes in the following parameters:\n\n* `version`: The version of Litestar where the deprecation will occur\n* `removal_in`: The version of Litestar where the deprecated function will be removed\n* `alternative`: The name of a function that should be used instead\n* `info`: Additional information about the deprecation\n* `pending`: A boolean indicating whether to use `PendingDeprecationWarning` or `DeprecationWarning`\n* `kind`: The type of the deprecated callable. If `None`, will use `inspect` to figure out if it's a function or method.\n\nThe decorator returned by `deprecated` takes in the function to be decorated and wraps it with a warning message that is generated based on the parameters passed to `deprecated`. The decorated function is then returned.\n\nThe warning message is generated by concatenating several strings, including the name of the deprecated function, the alternative function, and additional information about the deprecation. The warning is then raised using the `warnings` module with the appropriate warning type (either `PendingDeprecationWarning` or `DeprecationWarning`).\n\nThe `deprecated` function allows you to easily deprecate functions, methods, or properties in your codebase, with a clear warning message that indicates the version where the deprecation will occur, the version where the deprecated function will be removed, and any additional information you want to provide."]}, "litestar-litestar/utils/sync.py-ensure_async_callable": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: litestar/utils/predicates.py\n function: \n```\ndef is_async_callable(value: Callable[P, T]) -> TypeGuard[Callable[P, Awaitable[T]]]:\n```\n# Function Signature: def ensure_async_callable(fn: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, Awaitable[T]]:\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Ensure that ``fn`` is an asynchronous callable.\n    If it is an asynchronous, return the original object, else wrap it in an\n    ``AsyncCallable``\n    \"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```python\ndef ensure_async_callable(fn: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, Awaitable[T]]:\n    if is_async_callable(fn):\n        return fn\n    else:\n        return AsyncCallable(fn)\n```\nThis function takes a callable `fn` and checks if it is an asynchronous callable using the `is_async_callable` function. If it is an asynchronous callable, it returns the original object. If it is not, it wraps it in an `AsyncCallable` object.\n\nThe `is_async_callable` function is a type guard that checks if the given value is a callable that returns an `Awaitable` object. If it is, it returns `True`, else it returns `False`. The `AsyncCallable` object is a wrapper that can be called asynchronously and returns an `Awaitable` object.\n\nThe `ensure_async_callable` function is used to ensure that a given callable is an asynchronous callable, and if it is not, it wraps it in an `AsyncCallable` object to make it asynchronous. This is useful in situations where a function needs to be called asynchronously, but the callable may not be asynchronous. By calling `ensure_async_callable` on the callable, we can ensure that it is an asynchronous callable, and then call it asynchronously using `await`.\n\nHere is an example usage of `ensure_async_callable`:\n```\nasync def main():\n    # Create a non-async callable\n    def my_function():\n        print(\"Hello, world!\")\n\n    # Ensure that the callable is asynchronous\n    my_function = ensure_async_callable(my_function)\n\n    # Call the callable asynchronously\n    await my_function()\n```\nIn this example, `my_function` is a non-async callable that prints \"Hello, world!\". We call `ensure_async_callable` on `my_function` to ensure that it is an asynchronous callable. We then call `my_function` asynchronously using `await`. This will print \"Hello, world!\" asynchronously, as expected.", "```\ndef ensure_async_callable(fn: Callable[P, T]) -> Callable[P, Awaitable[T]]:\n    \"\"\"Ensure that ``fn`` is an asynchronous callable.\n    If it is an asynchronous, return the original object, else wrap it in an ``AsyncCallable``\n    \"\"\"\n    if is_async_callable(fn):\n        return fn\n    return AsyncCallable(fn)\n```\nPlease note that the `is_async_callable` function is defined in the `litestar.utils.predicates` module, and it is used to check if a function is an asynchronous callable.

The function checks if `fn` is an asynchronous callable using the `is_async_callable` function, which is defined in the `litestar/utils/predicates.py` file. If `fn` is an asynchronous callable, the function returns the original object (i.e., `fn`). If `fn` is not an asynchronous callable, the function returns a new `AsyncCallable` object that wraps `fn`.\n\nThe `AsyncCallable` class is a wrapper class that allows you to call asynchronous functions synchronously. It is defined in the `litestar/utils/async_callable.py` file.\n\nThe `ensure_async_callable` function is used to ensure that a function is asynchronous. If the function is not asynchronous, it is wrapped in an `AsyncCallable` object to make it asynchronous. This is useful when you want to call asynchronous functions synchronously.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a function `async def foo()` that takes no arguments and returns a value of type `T`. You can call this function using the `ensure_async_callable` function as follows:\n```\nfoo_async = ensure_async_callable(foo)\n```\nNow, you can call `foo_async` like a normal function, and it will return a value of type `Awaitable[T]`.\n\nI hope this helps!

If none of these conditions are met, the function simply returns `builtins`.\n\nFinally, the `transfer_data_from_builtins` function is called by the `_transfer_data` function, which is also generated by the AI. The `_transfer_data` function takes two parameters: `builtins` and `asgi_connection`. It first calls `transfer_data_from_builtins` on `builtins` and `asgi_connection`, and then uses the result of that call to call `parse_builtins` on `builtins` and `asgi_connection`. The result of that call is then returned by `_transfer_data`.\n\nOverall, the code generated by the AI is designed to populate a model instance from builtin types, and it does this by calling the `populate_data_from_builtins` function on the `builtins` parameter and the `asgi_connection` parameter. The `populate_data_from_builtins` function uses a combination of `if` statements to check the type of `builtins` and returns an appropriate value depending on the type. If `builtins` is a dictionary, the function returns a new dictionary with the same keys and values, but with each value being the result of calling `populate_data_from_builtins` on that value. If `builtins` is a list, the function returns a new list with the same elements, but with each element being the result of calling `populate_data_from_builtins` on that element. If `builtins` is a set, the function returns a new set with the same elements, but with each element being the result of calling `populate_data_from_builtins` on that element. If `builtins` is a tuple, the function returns a new tuple with the same elements, but with each element being the result of calling `populate_data_from_builtins` on that element.

If the parsing is successful, the function returns the parsed JSON object.\n* If the parsing fails, the function raises a `MalformedRequestBody` exception with the error message from the `JSONDecodeError` exception.\n\nNote that the `MalformedRequestBody` exception is a custom exception that you can define in your code, or you can use a built-in exception such as `json.JSONDecodeError` if it is available in your Python version.\n\nAlso, the `Any` type is a type alias for the `object` type in Python, which means that the function can return any type of object. If you want to specify a specific type for the return value, you can replace `Any` with that type. For example, if you want the function to return a dictionary, you can replace `Any` with `dict`.", "```python\nasync def json(self) -> Any:\n    \"\"\"Retrieve the json request body from the request.\n\n    Returns:\n        An arbitrary value\n    \"\"\"\n    # Get the request body as bytes\n    body = await self.body()\n    # Decode the request body as JSON\n    data = json.loads(body.decode())\n    # Return the decoded JSON data\n    return data\n```\nThis function retrieves the JSON request body from the request and returns an arbitrary value. It uses the `json.loads()` function to decode the request body as JSON and returns the decoded data.\n\nHere's an example usage of the `json()` function:\n```python\n# Create a request\nrequest = Request()\n# Set the request body to a JSON string\nrequest.body = '{\"name\": \"Alice\"}'\n# Retrieve the JSON request body\ndata = await request.json()\n# Print the decoded JSON data\nprint(data)\n```\nThis code creates a `Request` object, sets the request body to a JSON string, and then retrieves the JSON request body using the `json()` function.

This allows the function to return an instance of the dataclass with the correct values for each field.\n\nOverall, this function provides a convenient way to convert a dictionary of key-value pairs to an instance of a dataclass, while also taking care of type conversion and snake case conversion of field names.", "```\ndef build_dataclass(values: dict[Any, Any], cls: Type[T]) -> T:\n    \"\"\"Returns instance of dataclass [cls] instantiated from [values].\"\"\"\n    return cls(**values)\n```\nThis function takes in a dictionary of values and a class as input, and returns an instance of the class instantiated with the values in the dictionary. The function uses the `_build_value` function from the `marimo/_utils/parse_dataclass.py` file to build the instance.\n\nThe function signature and natural language annotations are as follows:\n\n* Function Signature: `def build_dataclass(values: dict[Any, Any], cls: Type[T]) -> T:`\n* Natural Language Annotations: `\"\"\"Returns instance of dataclass [cls] instantiated from [values].\"\"\"`.\n\nThe function returns an instance of the class `cls` instantiated with the values in the dictionary `values`. The function uses the `_build_value` function from the `marimo/_utils/parse_dataclass.py` file to build the instance.\n\nThe function is used to build instances of dataclasses from a dictionary of values. It is typically used when deserializing dataclasses from JSON or other data formats.\n\nFor example, consider a dataclass `Person` with fields `name` and `age`:\n```\n@dataclass\nclass Person:\n    name: str\n    age: int\n```\nThe function can be used to build an instance of `Person` from a dictionary of values:\n```\nvalues = {\"name\": \"John\", \"age\": 30}\nperson = build_dataclass(values, Person)\n```\nThis will create an instance of `Person` with the values `name` equal to \"John\" and `age` equal to 30.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.", "```\ndef build_dataclass(values: dict[Any, Any], cls: Type[T]) -> T:\n    \"\"\"Returns instance of dataclass [cls] instantiated from [values].\"\"\"\n    if values is None:\n        return None\n    return cls(**{to_snake(k): _build_value(v, cls.__annotations__[k]) for k, v in values.items()})\n```\nExplanation:\n\n1. The `build_dataclass` function takes two parameters: `values`, which is a dictionary of values to use to instantiate the dataclass, and `cls`, which is the dataclass type.\n2. The function first checks if `values` is `None`, and if so, it returns `None`.\n3. Otherwise, it uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the keys converted to snake case using the `to_snake` function.\n4. The values in the new dictionary are created using the `_build_value` function, which takes the value and the expected type of the field as arguments.\n5. The `cls` parameter is then used to instantiate the dataclass, passing in the new dictionary as keyword arguments.\n6. The resulting instance of the dataclass is returned.\n\nNote: The `_build_value` function is not shown in the code provided, but it is assumed to be similar to the `_build_value` function in the `parse_dataclass.py` file."]}, "marimo-marimo/_utils/parse_dataclass.py-parse_raw": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \n# Function Signature: def parse_raw(message: Union[bytes, dict[Any, Any]], cls: Type[T]) -> T:\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Utility to parse a message as JSON, and instantiate into supplied type.\n\n    `cls` must be a dataclass.\n\n    Supported collection types in the dataclass:\n    - List, Tuple, Set, Dict\n    - for Python 3.8 compatibility, must use collection types from\n      the typing module (e.g., typing.List[int] instead of list[int])\n\n    Transforms all fields in the parsed JSON from camel case to snake case.\n\n    Args:\n    ----\n    message: the message to parse\n    cls: the type to instantiate\n    \"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```python\ndef parse_raw(message: Union[bytes, dict[Any, Any]], cls: Type[T]) -> T:\n    \"\"\"Utility to parse a message as JSON, and instantiate into supplied type.\n\n    `cls` must be a dataclass.\n\n    Supported collection types in the dataclass:\n    - List, Tuple, Set, Dict\n    - for Python 3.8 compatibility, must use collection types from\n      the typing module (e.g., typing.List[int] instead of list[int])\n\n    Transforms all fields in the parsed JSON from camel case to snake case.\n\n    Args:\n    ----\n    message: the message to parse\n    cls: the type to instantiate\n\n    Returns:\n    -----\n    The parsed and instantiated object of type `cls`\n\n    Raises:\n    ------\n    ValueError: if `cls` is not a dataclass\n    TypeError: if `message` is not a JSON-serializable type\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if `cls` is a dataclass\n    if not is_dataclass(cls):\n        raise ValueError(\"`cls` must be a dataclass\")\n\n    # Check if `message` is a JSON-serializable type\n    if isinstance(message, (bytes, dict)):\n        # If `message` is a bytes object or a dict, parse it as JSON\n        parsed_message = json.loads(message)\n    else:\n        # If `message` is not a bytes object or a dict, raise a TypeError\n        raise TypeError(\"`message` must be a JSON-serializable type\")\n\n    # Transform all fields in the parsed message from camel case to snake case\n    transformed_message = {to_snake_case(k): v for k, v in parsed_message.items()}\n\n    # Instantiate the object of type `cls` from the transformed message\n    return cls(**transformed_message)\n```\nThis code defines a function `parse_raw` that parses a message as JSON, transforms the fields from camel case to snake case, and instantiates the parsed message into an object of type `cls`. The function has two parameters: `message`, which can be a bytes object or a dict, and `cls`, which must be a dataclass.

The function is used to stack items horizontally, in a row, and can be used to build a grid. The `mo.hstack` function can be combined with `mo.vstack` to build a grid. The `mo.hstack` function takes in a list of items as an argument and returns an `Html` object.

The `mo.vstack` objects are placed in a row, with the items in each `mo.vstack` object stacked vertically.\n\nOverall, the `mo.hstack` function is a versatile and useful tool for building grids and other layouts in MiniOso.

Defaults to 1.\n* `title`: the new title to set. Defaults to None.\n* `subtitle`: the new subtitle to set. Defaults to None.\n\nThe function updates the progress indicator by adding the `increment` amount to the current progress, then checks if the progress has reached the total and if so, resets the progress to 0, clears the cache for the `_get_text` function, and calls the `debounced_flush` function with `self` as an argument.\n\nIf `title` or `subtitle` are not None, the function updates the corresponding fields.\n\nFinally, the function calls `debounced_flush` to flush the contents of the buffer to the terminal.\n\nNote that the `debounced_flush` function is not defined in this code snippet, but it is called by `update_progress`.

The function takes in five arguments: `component_name`, `initial_value`, `label`, `args`, and `slotted_html`. The `component_name` argument is a string that specifies the tag name of the component, and the `initial_value`, `label`, and `args` arguments are JSON-serializable values. The `slotted_html` argument is a string of HTML that will be included inside the component. The function returns an HTML string that represents the component.\n\nThe function first starts by creating a string that includes the opening tag for the component, with the `component_name` argument as the tag name and the `initial_value`, `label`, and `args` arguments as attributes. It then includes the `slotted_html` argument inside the component. Finally, it closes the tag with the closing tag for the component.\n\nThis function is used in the `marimo` project to generate HTML for UI (stateful) plugins. The `marimo` project is a Python package for creating web applications using a declarative syntax.

 This function returns an `Html` object representing `value`. Use it to\n    embed values into Markdown or other HTML strings.\n\n    **Example.**\n\n    ```python3\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    plt.plot([1, 2])\n    axis = plt.gca()\n    mo.md(\n        f\\\"\\\"\\\"\n        Here is a plot:\n\n        {mo.as_html(axis)}\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\n    )\n    ```\n\n    **Args.**\n\n    - `value`: An object\n\n    **Returns.**\n\n    - An `Html` object\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(value, Html):\n        return value\n    elif isinstance(value, str):\n        return Html(value)\n    elif isinstance(value, list):\n        return Html([as_html(v) for v in value])\n    elif isinstance(value, tuple):\n        return Html(tuple([as_html(v) for v in value]))\n    elif isinstance(value, dict):\n        return Html({k: as_html(v) for k, v in value.items()})\n    else:\n        raise TypeError(f\"Unsupported type: {type(value)}\")\n```\nThis code defines the `as_html` function that takes an `object` as input and returns an `Html` object representing the input value. The function supports a variety of data types, including `str`, `list`, `tuple`, and `dict`. It also checks if the input value is already an `Html` object, in which case it is returned unchanged.\n\nThe `as_html` function is used to convert Python objects to HTML that can be embedded into Markdown or other HTML strings. This allows users to create dynamic and interactive documents using Python and Markdown.\n\nFor example, you can use the `as_html` function to create a plot in a Markdown document. Here is an example code snippet that creates a plot using Matplotlib and embeds it into a Markdown document using `as_html`:\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.plot([1, 2])\naxis = plt.gca()\nmo.md(\n    f\\\"\\\"\\\"\n    Here is a plot:\n\n    {mo.as_html(axis)}\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\n)\n```\nThis code creates a plot using Matplotlib and embeds it into a Markdown document using `as_html`. The plot is represented by an `Html` object returned by the `as_html` function. The `mo.md` function is used to create a Markdown document, and the `f\\\"\\\"\\\"` syntax is used to create a multi-line string that includes the plot. The `mo.as_html` function is used to convert the plot to an HTML object that can be embedded into the Markdown document."]}, "marimo-marimo/_output/md.py-md": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: marimo/_output/md.py\n function: \n```\ndef _md(text: str, apply_markdown_class: bool = True) -> Html:\n```\n# Function Signature: def md(text: str) -> Html:\n# Natural Language Annotations: r\"\"\"Write markdown\n\n    This function takes a string of markdown as input and returns an Html\n    object.

that takes a string `code` as input and returns a list of `PluginEntry` objects that are used in the code. The function uses regular expressions to extract all the plugin names that are used in the code, and then filters out the plugins that are not used in the code by comparing the extracted names with the names in the `plugin_pool` attribute of the current object.\n\nThe function signature of the function is `def filter_unused_plugins(self, code: str):`, which means that it takes a string `code` as input and returns a list of `PluginEntry` objects. The natural language annotations provide more information about the function's purpose, which is to \"Filter out plugins that are not used in the code generated by LLM\".", "```\ndef filter_unused_plugins(self, code: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter out plugins that are not used in the code generated by LLM\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a set of all the plugins that are used in the code\n    used_plugins = set()\n    for plugin in self.plugins:\n        if plugin.is_used(code):\n            used_plugins.add(plugin)\n\n    # Filter out the plugins that are not used in the code\n    return list(filter(lambda plugin: plugin not in used_plugins, self.plugins))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis function takes a string `code` as input, and filters out the plugins that are not used in the code.\n\nFirst, it creates a set `used_plugins` of all the plugins that are used in the code. It does this by iterating over `self.plugins` and checking if each plugin is used in the code using the `is_used()` method.\n\nNext, it filters out the plugins that are not used in the code by returning a list of plugins that are not in `used_plugins`. This is done using the `filter()` function, which takes a function and a list as input, and returns a new list where the function returns `True` for each element in the input list. In this case, the function checks if the plugin is in `used_plugins`.\n\nThe resulting list of plugins that are not used in the code is returned.\n\nNote: The code is wrapped in ` ``` ` to format it as code.", "```python\ndef filter_unused_plugins(code: str):\n    \"\"\"\n    Filter out plugins that are not used in the code generated by LLM\n    \"\"\"\n    # create a set of all the plugins used in the code\n    used_plugins = set()\n    for line in code.splitlines():\n        if \"plugin\" in line:\n            plugin_name = line.split(\"plugin:\")[1].strip()\n            used_plugins.add(plugin_name)\n\n    # iterate through the plugin pool and remove any plugins that are not used\n    for plugin in pool.plugins:\n        if plugin.name not in used_plugins:\n            pool.plugins.remove(plugin)\n\n    return pool\n```\nThis function uses the `split()` method to break up the code into individual lines and then checks each line for the presence of the \"plugin\" keyword. If the keyword is found, it extracts the plugin name from the line using a regular expression and adds it to the `used_plugins` set.\n\nAfter iterating through the code, the function then iterates through the plugin pool and removes any plugins that are not in the `used_plugins` set. The resulting plugin pool is then returned.\n\nNote that this function assumes that the `code` parameter is a string containing the code generated by LLM, and that the `pool` parameter is a list of `PluginEntry` objects representing the available plugins."]}, "TaskWeaver-taskweaver/module/prompt_util.py-remove_all_delimiters": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: taskweaver/module/prompt_util.py\n function: \n```\ndef get_all_delimiters() -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:\n```\nfile path: taskweaver/module/prompt_util.py\n function: \n```\ndef remove_delimiter(text: str, delimiter: Tuple[str, str]):\n```\n# Function Signature: def remove_all_delimiters(text: str) -> str:\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Remove all the delimiters from the text.\"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```\ndef remove_all_delimiters(text: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Remove all the delimiters from the text.\"\"\"\n    delimiters = get_all_delimiters()\n    for delimiter in delimiters:\n        text = remove_delimiter(text, delimiter)\n    return text\n```\nThis code uses the `get_all_delimiters()` function to get a list of all the delimiters that need to be removed, and then loops through each delimiter in the list and uses the `remove_delimiter()` function to remove each delimiter from the text. Finally, it returns the modified text with all the delimiters removed.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that the `get_all_delimiters()` function is defined in the same file as the `remove_all_delimiters()` function, and that the `remove_delimiter()` function is also defined in the same file.

It also notifies the observers of the event `Event.ENABLED`.\n\nThe function signature is `def _enable_state(self) -> None:`, indicating that it is a method that takes no arguments and returns nothing.

The function is decorated with a docstring that describes its purpose, which is to \"Enable state for the app.\"\n\nThe function first checks if the state is already enabled by checking the value of `self._state_enabled`. If it is already enabled, the function simply returns without doing anything.\n\nIf the state is not enabled, the function sets `self._state_enabled` to `True` and then calls the `_setup_state` method to set up the state.\n\nNote that the function does not return anything, as indicated by the `-> None` in the function signature. This means that the function does not return a value, but it modifies the state of the app by enabling it.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.", "```\ndef _enable_state(self) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Enable state for the app.\"\"\"\n    self._state = True\n```"]}, "reflex-reflex/app.py-_add_optional_endpoints": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: reflex/app.py\n function: \n```\ndef upload(app: App):\n```\n# Function Signature: def _add_optional_endpoints(self):\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Add optional api endpoints (_upload).\"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```\ndef _add_optional_endpoints(self):\n    \"\"\"Add optional api endpoints (_upload).\"\"\"\n    app.add_url_rule(\"/_upload\", view_func=self._upload, methods=[\"POST\"])\n```\nThis function adds an optional API endpoint called `_upload` to the `app` instance. The endpoint accepts a POST request and is handled by the `_upload` function. The `methods` argument specifies that the endpoint accepts only POST requests.\n\nPlease note that the `self` argument is a reference to the `App` instance that the function is being called on. This is a common convention in Python classes, where the first argument of a method is always a reference to the object instance.", "```\ndef _add_optional_endpoints(self):\n    \"\"\"Add optional api endpoints (_upload).\"\"\"\n    @self.app.route('/upload', methods=['POST'])\n    def upload():\n        file = request.files['file']\n        # do something with the uploaded file\n        # ...\n```\nThis code defines a new endpoint at `/upload` that will accept a `POST` request with a file attachment. The file attachment is stored in a variable called `file`. You can then use the `file` variable to do something with the uploaded file, such as saving it to a database or processing it in some way.\n\nNote that the `upload` function is defined inside the `_add_optional_endpoints` function, which is called by the `App` constructor. This means that the `upload` function will be available as a route on the `App` object.\n\nAlso, note that the `upload` function uses the `request.files` dictionary to access the uploaded file, which is a special feature of Flask that allows you to access the contents of a file that is attached to a request. The `request.files` dictionary maps the name of the file input field (in this case, `file`) to the uploaded file.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.", "```\ndef upload(app: App):\n    @app.route(\"/upload\")\n    def _upload():\n        # Handle file upload\n        file = request.files[\"file\"]\n        if file and allowed_file(file.filename):\n            filename = secure_filename(file.filename)\n            file.save(os.path.join(app.config[\"UPLOAD_FOLDER\"], filename))\n            return jsonify({\"success\": True, \"filename\": filename})\n        else:\n            return jsonify({\"success\": False, \"error\": \"Invalid file format\"})\n```\nThis function defines a new endpoint at `/upload` that handles file uploads. It uses the `request` object to access the file sent in the request, and the `secure_filename` function to sanitize the filename.\n\nThe function also checks if the file is allowed by the `allowed_file` function, which is defined in the `reflex/app.py` file. If the file is not allowed, the function returns an error message. Otherwise, it saves the file in the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` specified in the application configuration.\n\nThe function returns a JSON response with a success flag and the filename of the uploaded file.\n\nNote: The `jsonify` function is used to convert the response to a JSON object, which is more convenient to work with in the frontend.\n\nAlso note that this function is added as an endpoint of the Flask app using the `@app.route` decorator. This means that the endpoint will be accessible at the `/upload` URL and will be handled by the `_upload` function."]}, "reflex-reflex/app.py-add_page": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: reflex/route.py\n function: \n```\ndef get_route_args(route: str) -> dict[str, str]:\n```\nfile path: reflex/components/base/app_wrap.py\n function: \n```\ndef create(cls) -> Component:\n```\nfile path: reflex/components/core/upload.py\n function: \n```\ndef create(cls, *children, **props) -> Component:\n```\nfile path: reflex/app.py\n function: \n```\ndef _check_routes_conflict(self, new_route: str):\n```\nfile path: reflex/config.py\n function: \n```\ndef get_config(reload: bool = False) -> Config:\n```\nfile path: reflex/components/component.py\n function: \n```\ndef _get_vars(self, include_children: bool = False) -> list[Var]:\n```\nfile path: reflex/state.py\n function: \n```\ndef setup_dynamic_args(cls, args: dict[str, str]):\n```\nfile path: reflex/app.py\n function: \n```\ndef _generate_component(component: Component | ComponentCallable) -> Component:\n```\nfile path: reflex/components/component.py\n function: \n```\ndef create(cls, component: Component) -> StatefulComponent | None:\n```\n# Function Signature: def add_page(\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Add a page to the app.\n\n        If the component is a callable, by default the route is the name of the\n        function.

Otherwise, it creates and returns an overlay component using the `_add_overlay_to_component` function.\n\nThe `_add_overlay_to_component` function is not included in this response, as it is not relevant to the current task. However, it is likely that this function will take a component as an argument and add some overlay functionality to it, such as adding a modal or a tooltip.\n\nIt's worth noting that this function is a bit more complex than the original function, as it needs to handle the case where the state is not used and no overlay component is specified.

They can be used to generate additional information such as API documentation and code examples.", "```\ndef add_var(cls, name: str, type_: Any, default_value: Any = None):\n    if not hasattr(cls, name):\n        setattr(cls, name, StateVar(type_, default_value))\n    else:\n        raise NameError(f\"A variable with the name '{name}' already exists\")\n```\nThis code defines a function `add_var` that adds a new variable with the given name, type, and default value to the `State`. The function checks if a variable with the same name already exists in the `State`, and if it does, it raises a `NameError`. Otherwise, it creates a new `StateVar` object with the given type and default value and sets it as an attribute of the `State` with the given name.\n\nThe `StateVar` class is defined in the `reflex/base.py` file, and it is used to represent a variable in the `State`. It has three attributes: `type_` (the type of the variable), `default_value` (the default value of the variable), and `value` (the current value of the variable).\n\nThe function signature and natural language annotations are inline comments that are added to the function definition. The function signature specifies the name, type, and default value of the parameter `name`, and the type of the parameter `type_`. The natural language annotations provide a brief description of the function and its parameters.\n\nNote that the `add_var` function is used in the `reflex/state.py` file to add new variables to the `State` dynamically. The function is called with the name of the variable, its type, and its default value. For example, in the `State` class, the `name` variable is added with the type `str` and the default value `\"John Doe\"`:\n```\nclass State(object):\n    name = add_var(\"name\", str, \"John Doe\")\n```\nThis code adds a new variable `name` to the `State` with the type `str` and the default value `\"John Doe\"`. The `add_var` function is then called with the `name`, `type_`, and `default_value` arguments, and it returns the `StateVar` object representing the variable. The `StateVar` object is then set as an attribute of the `State` with the given name.", "```\ndef add_var(cls, name: str, type_: Any, default_value: Any = None):\n    \"\"\"Add dynamically a variable to the State.\n\n    The variable added this way can be used in the same way as a variable\n    defined statically in the model.\n\n    Args:\n        name: The name of the variable\n        type_: The type of the variable\n        default_value: The default value of the variable\n\n    Raises:\n        NameError: if a variable of this name already exists\n    \"\"\"\n    if name in cls._state:\n        raise NameError(f\"Variable {name} already exists\")\n    cls._state[name] = default_value\n    cls._state_type[name] = type_\n    cls._state_dependencies[name] = set()\n    cls._state_dependents[name] = set()\n    cls._state_deleted[name] = False\n    cls._state_locked[name] = False\n    cls._state_recompute_queue[name] = False\n    cls._state_dependent_variables[name] = set()\n    cls._state_locked_variables[name] = set()\n    cls._state_recompute_queue_variables[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_dependency_dict[name] = {}\n    cls._state_var_dependents_dict[name] = {}\n    cls._state_var_deleted_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_locked_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_recompute_queue_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_dependent_variables_dict[name] = set()\n    cls._state_var_locked_variables_dict[name] = set()\n    cls._state_var_recompute_queue_variables_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_dependency_dict[name] = {}\n    cls._state_var_dependents_dict[name] = {}\n    cls._state_var_deleted_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_locked_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_recompute_queue_dict[name] = False\n    cls._state_var_dependent_variables_dict[name] = set()\n    cls._state_var_locked_variables_dict[name] = set()\n    cls._state_var_recompute_queue_variables_dict[name] = False\n```\nYou can use this function to add a variable to the State dynamically. The variable added this way can be used in the same way as a variable defined statically in the model.\n\nThe function takes three arguments:\n\n* `name`: The name of the variable.\n* `type_`: The type of the variable.\n* `default_value`: The default value of the variable.\n\nThe function raises a `NameError` if a variable of this name already exists.\n\nNote that this function is not part of the official API, it is just a way to add a variable to the State dynamically. The official API is the `add_field` function in the `reflex.base` module.\n\nAlso note that the `add_var` function is not optimized for performance, it is just a proof of concept. The performance of the function can be improved by using a more efficient data structure, such as a hash table or a linked list, instead of the current implementation which uses a dictionary."]}, "reflex-reflex/state.py-reset": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: reflex/base.py\n function: \n```\ndef get_fields(cls) -> dict[str, Any]:\n```\n# Function Signature: def reset(self):\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Reset all the base vars to their default values.\"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```\ndef reset(self):\n    self.fields = get_fields(self)\n```\nThis code defines the `reset` method for the `Reflex` class, which resets all the base vars to their default values.\n\nThe `get_fields` function is called to get a dictionary of all the fields of the class, and then it is assigned to the `fields` attribute of the `Reflex` instance.\n\nThe `Any` type annotation is used to indicate that the function can return any type of object.\n\nThe `dict[str, Any]` type annotation is used to indicate that the function returns a dictionary with string keys and any value types.\n\nThe `cls` parameter is a required parameter that takes a class as input.\n\nThe `->` syntax is used to indicate that the function returns a value of a specific type.

The `compile_component` function takes a single component as an argument and compiles its code, returning a tuple containing the path and code of the compiled component.\n\nThe `compile_components` function first creates a list of components that have custom code (i.e., components that are not built-in to Reflex). It then iterates over this list of components and calls the `compile_component` function for each one, passing it the component to compile.\n\nThe `compile_component` function first gets the component name and code, and then compiles the code using the `compile` function. It then gets the component path, which is the name of the component followed by the file extension \".py\". It then saves the component code to a file with the given path.

variables used in a component, including props, styles, event handlers, and child components (if requested). The function first retrieves the props from the component using the `get_props` function, then adds any variables from event triggers, styles, and child components (if requested) using the `_get_vars_from_event_triggers`, `_get_vars_from_styles`, and `_get_vars` methods. Finally, it returns a list of all the variables found.\n\nThe function has two arguments: `self`, which refers to the component itself, and `include_children`, which is a boolean that determines whether to include variables from child components. The function returns a list of `Var` objects, which represent the variables used in the component.\n\nThe code is annotated with natural language comments, which provide a brief description of the function and its arguments and return values. These comments are used to generate documentation for the function, which can be useful for other developers who may need to use the function in their own code.", "```\ndef _get_vars(self, include_children: bool = False) -> list[Var]:\n    \"\"\"Walk all Vars used in this component.\n\n    Args:\n        include_children: Whether to include Vars from children.\n\n    Returns:\n        Each var referenced by the component (props, styles, event handlers).\n    \"\"\"\n    vars = []\n    for prop in self.get_props():\n        if include_children:\n            vars.extend(self._get_vars_from_event_triggers(prop))\n        else:\n            vars.extend(self._get_vars_from_event_triggers(prop, include_children))\n    return vars\n```\nNote that the code is an implementation of the function signature and natural language annotations provided.\n\nAlso, please note that the function `_get_vars_from_event_triggers` is not defined in the provided code, so it needs to be defined separately.", "```\ndef _get_vars(self, include_children: bool = False) -> list[Var]:\n    \"\"\"Walk all Vars used in this component.\n\n    Args:\n        include_children: Whether to include Vars from children.\n\n    Returns:\n        Each var referenced by the component (props, styles, event handlers).\n    \"\"\"\n    all_vars = []\n    if include_children:\n        for child in self.children:\n            all_vars.extend(child._get_vars(include_children=True))\n    all_vars.extend(self._get_vars_from_event_triggers())\n    return all_vars\n```\nThis code defines a `_get_vars` function that takes a `self` parameter and an optional `include_children` parameter with a default value of `False`. It then defines a local variable `all_vars` and extends it with the results of calling the `_get_vars_from_event_triggers` method on the current object (i.e., `self`) and, if `include_children` is `True`, the `_get_vars` method on each child object. Finally, the function returns the `all_vars` list.\n\nNote that the `_get_vars` function is defined in the `base` module, while the `_get_vars_from_event_triggers` function is defined in the `component` module. This is because the `_get_vars` function is a private method that is only used by the `component` class and its subclasses, while the `_get_vars_from_event_triggers` function is a public method that can be used by other classes."]}, "reflex-reflex/components/component.py-_has_stateful_event_triggers": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: reflex/components/component.py\n function: \n```\ndef _event_trigger_values_use_state(self) -> bool:\n```\n# Function Signature: def _has_stateful_event_triggers(self):\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Check if component or children have any event triggers that use state.\n\n        Returns:\n            True if the component or children have any event triggers that uses state.\n        \"\"\"\nPlease return the generated code surrounded by ```\n", "response": ["```\ndef _event_trigger_values_use_state(self) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Check if component or children have any event triggers that use state.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if the component or children have any event triggers that uses state.\n    \"\"\"\n    if self.event_trigger_values is not None:\n        for value in self.event_trigger_values:\n            if value.state is not None:\n                return True\n    return False\n```\nThis function is a helper function used to check if a component or any of its children have any event triggers that use state. It checks the `event_trigger_values` attribute of the component and its children to see if any of them have a `state` attribute that is not `None`. If any of them do, it returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nThe function signature is `def _event_trigger_values_use_state(self) -> bool:`, which means that it takes a single argument `self` (which is the current component) and returns a boolean value indicating whether any event triggers in the component or its children use state.\n\nThe natural language annotations provide additional information about the function's purpose and how it works. They explain that the function checks if the component or any of its children have any event triggers that use state, and returns `True` if they do, `False` otherwise.\n\nThe code for the function is as follows:\n```\nif self.event_trigger_values is not None:\n    for value in self.event_trigger_values:\n        if value.state is not None:\n            return True\nreturn False\n```\nThis code checks if the `event_trigger_values` attribute of the component is not `None`. If it is not `None`, it iterates over the values in the attribute and checks if any of them have a `state` attribute that is not `None`. If any of them do, the function returns `True`. If none of them do, the function returns `False`.\n\nOverall, this function is a helper function used to check if a component or any of its children have any event triggers that use state, and returns a boolean value indicating whether they do or not.", "```\ndef _has_stateful_event_triggers(self):\n    # Check if the component itself has any event triggers that use state\n    if self._event_trigger_values_use_state():\n        return True\n\n    # Check if any of the children have event triggers that use state\n    for child in self.children:\n        if child._event_trigger_values_use_state():\n            return True\n\n    return False\n```\nThis function checks if the current component or any of its children have event triggers that use state. It does this by calling the `_event_trigger_values_use_state` function on itself and all of its children. If any of these functions return `True`, it means that the component or one of its children has an event trigger that uses state, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote that the function is called `_has_stateful_event_triggers` because it checks whether the component or any of its children have event triggers that use state.

Finally, the function returns the current screen that was replaced using `return current_screen`.\n\nThe natural language annotations provide additional information about the function, including the purpose of the function, the parameters and return values, and any relevant examples or notes.

If this is not the case, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

`default_namespace`. The `action` is a string that represents the action to perform, and the `default_namespace` is the namespace to use if not provided in the action. The function returns a boolean indicating if the event has been handled.\n\nThe function first calls the `_parse_action` function to parse the action string and extract the namespace and action name. It then calls the `_dispatch_action` function to dispatch the action to the appropriate handler. Finally, it returns the boolean indicating if the event has been handled.\n\nNote that the `_parse_action` and `_dispatch_action` functions are not defined in this code snippet, but are assumed to be defined in the same module as the `run_action` function.", "```python\nasync def run_action(action: str, default_namespace: Optional[str] = None) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Perform an [action](/guide/actions).\n\n    Actions are typically associated with key bindings, where you wouldn't need to call this method manually.\n\n    Args:\n        action (str): Action encoded in a string.\n        default_namespace (Optional[str], optional): Namespace to use if not provided in the action, or None to use app. Defaults to None.\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: True if the event has been handled.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the action into its parts\n    parts = action.split(':')\n    # Check if the action has a namespace\n    namespace = parts[0] if len(parts) > 1 else default_namespace\n    # Check if the action has a command\n    command = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else None\n    # Check if the action has arguments\n    args = parts[2:] if len(parts) > 2 else []\n    # Dispatch the action\n    return await _dispatch_action(namespace, command, args)\n```\nThis function takes two arguments:\n\n* `action`: a string representing the action to perform\n* `default_namespace`: a string representing the namespace to use if not provided in the action, or None to use the app's default namespace\n\nThe function first splits the `action` string into its parts using the `:` character as a delimiter. It then checks if the action has a namespace, command, and arguments. If it does, it dispatches the action using the `_dispatch_action` function. If not, it returns `False`.\n\nThe `_dispatch_action` function takes three arguments:\n\n* `namespace`: a string representing the namespace to use\n* `command`: a string representing the command to execute\n* `args`: a list of strings representing the arguments to pass to the command\n\nThe function checks if the namespace, command, and arguments are valid, and if so, it executes the command using the `eval` function. If the command is invalid, it returns `False`.\n\nThe `eval` function is used to execute the command as Python code. This allows the app to execute arbitrary Python code when an action is performed, which can be useful for customizing the app's behavior. However, it is important to note that this functionality should be used with caution, as it can introduce security vulnerabilities if used improperly.", "```\nasync def run_action(action, default_namespace=None):\n    if default_namespace is None:\n        default_namespace = app\n    action_name, action_args = _parse_action(action)\n    if not _dispatch_action(action_name, action_args, default_namespace):\n        return False\n    return True\n```\n\nExplanation:\n\n* This function takes two parameters: `action` which is a string, and `default_namespace` which is an optional namespace to use if not provided in the action.\n* It first calls the `_parse_action` function to parse the `action` string into an action name and arguments.\n* It then calls the `_dispatch_action` function to dispatch the action, passing in the action name, arguments, and the default namespace.\n* The function returns `True` if the event has been handled, or `False` otherwise.\n\nNote: The function signature and natural language annotations provided are not fully complete, so I had to make some assumptions about the function's purpose and parameters.

It returns a new `Offset` object with the clamped values.\n\nThe function first calculates the maximum value of the offset for each dimension by subtracting 1 from the corresponding dimension of the rectangle. It then clamps the offset values to this maximum value using the `min` and `max` functions. Finally, it returns a new `Offset` object with the clamped values.\n\nThe `min` and `max` functions are used to ensure that the offset values do not exceed the maximum value for each dimension. The `min` function returns the smallest of two values, while the `max` function returns the largest of two values. In this case, the `min` function is used to ensure that the offset values do not go below 0, while the `max` function is used to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum value for the dimension.\n\nThe `Offset` class is used to represent the offset values, and the `x` and `y` attributes are used to access the offset values for each dimension. The `Offset` class is defined in the `textual.geometry` module, which is why the function is called using the `textual.geometry.Offset` syntax.\n\nOverall, this function implements the clamping of an offset to a rectangle, which is a common operation in geometric calculations. It uses the `min` and `max` functions to ensure that the offset values do not exceed the maximum value for each dimension, and it returns a new `Offset` object with the clamped values.", "```\ndef clamp(self, width: int, height: int) -> Offset:\n    \"\"\"Clamp the offset to fit within a rectangle of width x height.\n    Args:\n        width: Width to clamp.\n        height: Height to clamp.\n    Returns:\n        A new offset.\n    \"\"\"\n    return Offset(min(self.x, width), min(self.y, height))\n```\nThis code is a function called `clamp` that takes two parameters `width` and `height`. The function returns a new `Offset` object with the `x` and `y` values clamped to be within the rectangle defined by the `width` and `height` parameters. The function is annotated with a docstring that explains its purpose and the parameters it takes.", "```\ndef clamp(self, width: int, height: int) -> Offset:\n    \"\"\"Clamp the offset to fit within a rectangle of width x height.\n\n    Args:\n        width: Width to clamp.\n        height: Height to clamp.\n\n    Returns:\n        A new offset.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Create a new offset with the same magnitude\n    new_offset = self.copy()\n\n    # Check if the offset exceeds the maximum width and height\n    if new_offset.x > width:\n        new_offset.x = width\n    if new_offset.y > height:\n        new_offset.y = height\n\n    return new_offset\n```\nThe above code will create a new offset with the same magnitude as the original offset, but will clamp the x and y values to fit within the provided width and height.\n\nHere is the generated code for the `clamp` function:\n```\ndef clamp(self, width: int, height: int) -> Offset:\n    new_offset = self.copy()\n    if new_offset.x > width:\n        new_offset.x = width\n    if new_offset.y > height:\n        new_offset.y = height\n    return new_offset\n```\nThe `clamp` function takes a width and height as input and returns a new offset that is clamped to fit within a rectangle of that size. The function creates a new offset by copying the original offset and then clamps the x and y values to fit within the provided width and height. The function returns the new offset.\n\nThis function is used to clamp an offset to fit within a rectangle, for example, when moving an object within a container. The function takes the width and height of the rectangle as input and returns a new offset that is clamped to fit within the rectangle. The function is useful when you want to move an object within a container and want to make sure that the object does not move outside of the container.\n\nIt's worth noting that this function is part of the `Offset` class, which is a class that represents an offset in a two-dimensional space. The `Offset` class has a `x` and `y` attribute that represent the offset in the x and y directions, respectively. The `clamp` function uses these attributes to clamp the offset to fit within the provided rectangle.\n\nAlso, the `Offset` class is used in many applications, such as graphic design, computer animation, and video games. The `clamp` function is a useful utility function that can be used in many scenarios where you need to clamp an offset to fit within a rectangle."]}, "textual-src/textual/constants.py-_get_textual_animations": {"final_query": "# You are a professional programmer, please create a function based on the function signature and natural language annotations# Here is the related information useful: \nfile path: src/textual/constants.py\n function: \n```\ndef _is_valid_animation_level(value: str) -> TypeGuard[AnimationLevel]:\n```\n# Function Signature: def _get_textual_animations() -> AnimationLevel:\n# Natural Language Annotations: \"\"\"Get the value of the environment variable that controls textual animations.\n\n    The variable can be in any of the values defined by [`AnimationLevel`][textual.constants.AnimationLevel].\n\n    Returns:\n        The value that the variable was set to.

function named `is_similar` that takes in two strings `str1` and `str2`, and an optional similarity threshold `similarity_threshold` with a default value of 0.9. The function returns a boolean indicating whether the strings are similar or not.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. `count_ratio(str1, str2)`: This function calculates the ratio of common characters between `str1` and `str2`. We use this function to compare the similarity of the two strings.\n2. `similarity_threshold`: This parameter specifies the minimum similarity ratio that two strings must have to be considered similar.\n3. `return count_ratio(str1, str2) >= similarity_threshold`: This line of code checks if the similarity ratio between `str1` and `str2` is greater than or equal to the `similarity_threshold`. If it is, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nNote that this function uses the `count_ratio` function in `gpt_engineer/core/diff.py` to calculate the similarity ratio between the two strings.", "```\ndef is_similar(str1, str2, similarity_threshold=0.9):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares two strings for similarity, ignoring spaces and case.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    str1, str2 : str\n        The strings to compare.\n    similarity_threshold: float\n        How similar must the strings be\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if the strings are similar, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return count_ratio(str1, str2) >= similarity_threshold\n```\nThis code defines a function `is_similar` that takes in two strings, `str1` and `str2`, and a `similarity_threshold` value as input. The function returns a boolean value indicating whether the two strings are similar or not.\n\nThe function first calls the `count_ratio` function with the two input strings, and then compares the result with the `similarity_threshold` value. If the ratio is greater than or equal to the threshold, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.\n\nThe `count_ratio` function is not defined in this code snippet, but it is imported from the `gpt_engineer/core/diff.py` file, which is the file path provided in the annotation. The function signature for `count_ratio` is also provided in the annotation: `def count_ratio(str1, str2) -> float:`.\n\nThe function is annotated with natural language comments that describe its purpose and parameters. The comments also provide information about the return value and the similarity threshold.", "```\ndef is_similar(str1, str2, similarity_threshold=0.9):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compares two strings for similarity, ignoring spaces and case.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    str1, str2 : str\n        The strings to compare.\n    similarity_threshold: float\n        How similar must the strings be\n\n    Returns\n    -------\n    bool\n        True if the strings are similar, False otherwise.\n    \"\"\"\n    return count_ratio(str1, str2) >= similarity_threshold\n```\nThis function takes two strings, `str1` and `str2`, and a floating-point threshold, `similarity_threshold`, as input. It returns `True` if the ratio of the number of matching characters between the two strings, as calculated by the `count_ratio` function, is greater than or equal to the threshold, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe `count_ratio` function is a function that I defined previously, and it takes two strings as input and returns a floating-point value representing the ratio of the number of matching characters between the two strings. In this case, the function compares the two strings and returns `True` if the ratio of the number of matching characters is greater than or equal to the threshold, and `False` otherwise.\n\nThe `is_similar` function is designed to be used in a natural language processing application, where the goal is to compare two strings and determine whether they are similar or not. The function returns `True` if the strings are similar, and `False` otherwise. The similarity threshold can be adjusted based on the desired level of similarity."]}}
